# Fitness Center Web Service â€“ Build a RESTful Web Service Application
## Project Description
This is my very own back-end Web Service for the Lab 1 of the Web Services and Distributed Computing class in the Winter 2024 semester @ Champlain College.
The files in this repository, as well as this README, will contain the progress of the design and programming of the said web service.
The service is based on a Fitness center, or a Gym if you prefer. It's going to implement clients, employees, memberships and purchases as the main
entities of this project. The project is setup using SpringBoot and Java, as well as a Docker container for the database.
